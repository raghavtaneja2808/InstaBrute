Instagram Password Cracker using Selenium
Introduction
Welcome to the Instagram Password Cracker built using Selenium! This project is designed to automate login attempts on Instagram and crack passwords using a custom wordlist generator that mimics human-like password creation patterns. Our unique approach makes it difficult for Instagram's systems to detect the process as automated, allowing for a slower, human-like simulation that bypasses common "robot" detection mechanisms.

Disclaimer
‚ö†Ô∏è For Educational Purposes Only!
This tool is designed to teach the importance of password security. Unauthorized use of this software to gain access to any account is illegal and unethical. Only use this tool for testing purposes with explicit permission from account owners. Misuse of this project is strictly discouraged and can result in serious legal consequences.

How It Works
1. Selenium for Automated Login Attempts
Selenium is a powerful browser automation tool that we use to interact with Instagram‚Äôs login page. Here‚Äôs how the process works:

Automated Browser Interaction: Selenium opens a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox), navigates to Instagram, and inputs credentials from the generated wordlist.
Human-Like Behavior: Unlike traditional brute-force tools that quickly send requests to Instagram, Selenium interacts with the page at a slower, more natural pace to mimic human actions. This minimizes the risk of triggering Instagram's bot detection mechanisms.
Key Features:
Customizable Delay: The tool allows for customizable delays between login attempts to avoid detection.
Complete Automation: From filling out the login form to submitting credentials, everything is automated.
Real-Time Feedback: The tool checks whether login attempts are successful or blocked, and reports it in real time.
2. Human-Like Wordlist Generator
The password cracker includes a powerful wordlist generator that creates password guesses based on human-like patterns, making it more efficient at cracking real-world passwords.

How the Wordlist Generator Works:
Custom Input: The wordlist generator asks for personal details like:
First name
Last name
Date of birth
Nickname
Instagram username
Special dates
Other meaningful names (e.g., siblings, friends, significant others)
Human-Like Patterns: The generator creates combinations of names, dates, and symbols in ways that mimic how people typically create passwords:
Uses parts of names (first letters, full names, uppercase, lowercase).
Combines names with birthdates (e.g., John@28, Doe_1990).
Adds special characters like @, #, !, and more to increase complexity.
Supports a wide range of combinations to make password guesses as comprehensive as possible.
Key Features:
Realistic Passwords: The generator creates passwords in formats commonly used by people, increasing the likelihood of successful password guesses.
Comprehensive Combinations: Generates a large variety of passwords using combinations of names, dates, and symbols, ensuring no common pattern is missed.
Customizable Inputs: You can easily tailor the wordlist by inputting different names, dates, or symbols, making it more specific to the target.
3. Stealth Features:
One of the standout features of this project is its stealth capability. The slower interaction speed, paired with human-like delays, prevents Instagram from flagging the attempts as automated. Here's why:

Natural Interaction Speed: Most brute-force tools are easily caught because they submit login attempts too quickly. Our tool, however, simulates a user manually typing each username and password, pausing naturally between each step.
Variable Delays: You can configure the time delay between login attempts to avoid tripping Instagram‚Äôs security systems. This ensures that the system cannot detect the login attempts as bot activity.
How to Use
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-password-cracker.git
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Set Up the Wordlist
Run the wordlist generator to create a custom password list based on user inputs. Execute the script and follow the prompts:

bash
Copy code
python wordlist_generator.py
The generated wordlist will be saved to a file named wordlist.txt in the project directory.

Step 4: Run the Password Cracker
After generating the wordlist, use the main script to begin cracking Instagram passwords. Be sure to input the target‚Äôs username and wordlist path:

bash
Copy code
python instagram_cracker.py --username <target_username> --wordlist wordlist.txt
Special Features
Customizable Wordlists: Generate wordlists that use personal details like names, dates of birth, and common symbols.
Stealth Mode: Slow, human-like automation ensures that the tool operates under Instagram‚Äôs bot detection radar.
Configurable Delays: Adjust the delay time between login attempts to simulate real user behavior.
Real-Time Feedback: Receive immediate feedback on whether a password attempt was successful or failed.

Important Notes
Ensure that you have proper permission before testing any Instagram accounts with this tool.
Avoid using the tool on your main account, as excessive failed login attempts can lead to account restrictions or bans.
